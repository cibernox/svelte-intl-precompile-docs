  "introduction.paragraph.why-use-it-2": "To accomplish that it takes a different approach to most internalization libraries. Much like Svelte.js analyzes and understands your code and at build time compiles it to minimal and efficient javascript, this library inspects your translations defined in the  <a href='https://lokalise.com/blog/complete-guide-to-icu-message-format' class='text-primary underline'>ICU message syntax</a> and compiles them to small and efficient inline functions.",
  "introduction.paragraph.why-use-it-3": "If you use each and every feature supported by the ICU message syntax it will add around 2kb to your bundle after minification and compression. If you only use a few, it can go as low as 1kb.",
  "introduction.paragraph.why-use-it-4": "Since it doesn't have to parse and tokenize your translations in the browser, it is also faster. Around 4 times faster rendering a translation for the first time, and around 50% faster for already known translations.",

  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.main-1": "This library analyzes and compiles the translations authored in the ICU message syntax. While the ICU message syntax is an independent proyect this is an accelerated course on why it's good and how to use the main features.",
  "icu-crash-course.subsection.why": "Why use the ICU message syntax?",
  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.why-1": "ICU stands for <em class='italic'>International Components for Unicode</em>. While its popularity begun in C/C++ and Java, it's the javascript ecosystem where it has become the defacto standard for internationalization, although it's also popular in Python and PHP.",
  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.why-2": "Internationalizing apps is a whole lot more than just mapping some keys to the appropriate translated string in a dictionary. Properly internationalized apps must handle all aspects of translation, including the way dates and times are formatted, what delimiters are used in numbers to separate the thousands or the decimals, currencies and support gendered languages.",
  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.why-3": "Even something as simple as plurals can get very complex depending on the language. English, German and Spanish have singular and plural, but some slavic languages have 3, and other languages like Arabic have 6 depending on the number of items being pluralized. Sometimes the threshold where we have to change from one plural form to the next varies depending on the reginal variant. <br> English doesn't have many gendered words but French or Italian do, and the adjectives must match the noun's gender. Formatting <code class='inline'>123456789</code> in the US english variant will result in <code class='inline'>123,456,789</code> but in the Indian variant will be <code class='inline'>12,34,56,789</code>. <br> Formatting currencies the $ symbol goes before the amount, but the € goes after.",
  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.why-4": "The ICU syntax abstracts all this complexity from the developers and gives the real professional translators a meta language expressive enough to handle all the subtleties on they side.",
  "icu-crash-course.subsection.interpolations": "Interpolations",
  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.interpolations-1": "ICU messages support interpolating values, which will be properly sanitized so passing <code class='inline'>undefined</code> will not interpolate as <em class='italic'>\"undefined\"</em>.",

  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.plurals-1": "The second most used feature in any app is pluralization. The ICU syntax has a dedicated <code class='inline'>plural</code> helper to define plural translations that from very simple to quite complicated, all within the translation itself.",
  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.plurals-2": "Each path for the plural is prefixed with the numeric qualifier. The possible qualifiers are:",
  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.plurals-3": "Lets see some examples first:",
  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.plurals-4": "Some languages like English only leverage <code class='inline'>one</code> and <code class='inline'>other</code> but others will be able to use the best plural form. The particular threshold value that divides <code class='inline'>few</code> and <code class='inline'>many</code> is heavily cultural.",
  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.plurals-5": "You can also specify translations for exact values using <code class='inline'>=N</code>. When a number is specified that way that translation will supersede the language's default behavior. <br> For instance, in english you could use <code class='inline'>=2</code> or <code class='inline'>=12</code> to have different translations specifically for a couple and a dozen instead of using the generic plural.",
  "icu-crash-course.paragraph.plurals-6": "Lastly, plurals can also make us of the hashtag to print as number the value being used in the plural, and optionally the helper can receive an offset that will be substracted to the value in the hashtag.",
